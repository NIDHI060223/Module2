# JavaScript Learning Project

This project demonstrates various JavaScript concepts, including output methods, event handling, and subtotal price calculation. Each section corresponds to a specific question, 
providing examples and practical use cases.

## **Question 1: Calculate Subtotal Price of Quantity in JavaScript**

### Description:
- This example calculates the subtotal and total prices dynamically based on the quantity entered by the user.
- It also includes a "Remove" button to delete a product row and recalculate the totals.

### How It Works:
- **HTML**: A table structure to display products with their prices and quantities.
- **CSS**: Styles the table for a clean layout.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Dynamically calculates subtotal prices as quantities are updated.
  - Recalculates the total price when a row is removed.

### Code Files:
- `subtotal-calculation.html` (Main HTML file)
- `subtotal.js` (JavaScript logic)
- `subtotal.css` (Styling)

### Steps to Use:
1. Open `subtotal-calculation.html` in a browser.
2. Adjust the quantity values in the table and observe the subtotal updates.
3. Click "Remove" to delete a row and recalculate the total price.

## **Question 2: What Are JavaScript Output Methods?**

### Description:
Output methods are used to display information to users in various ways.

### Key Output Methods:
1. **`console.log()`**:
   - Logs messages to the browser console, mainly for debugging.
   - Example: `console.log("Hello, World!");`

2. **`document.write()`**:
   - Writes content directly into the HTML document.
   - Example: `document.write("Hello, World!");`

3. **`alert()`**:
   - Displays a popup message with an "OK" button.
   - Example: `alert("Hello, World!");`

4. **`innerHTML`**:
   - Updates the content of an HTML element dynamically.
   - Example: `document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";`

## **Question 3: How to Use JavaScript Output Methods?**

### Description:
This example combines all four output methods to demonstrate their usage in a single file.


### Steps to Use:
1. Open the file in a browser.
2. Observe the following:
   - **Console Output**: Message logged in the browser's console.
   - **HTML Content**: "Hello, World!" written on the page.
   - **Alert Box**: Popup message with "Hello, World!".

## **Question 4: How to Use JavaScript Events?**

### Description:
Demonstrates different JavaScript events, categorized as follows:

### Event Types and Examples:
1. **Window Events**:
   - `load`, `unload`, `scroll`, and `resize`.
   - Example: Logs messages when the page is loaded, unloaded, or resized.

2. **Mouse Events**:
   - `click`, `dblclick`, `mouseover`, and more.
   - Example: Logs mouse interactions like hover or clicks.

3. **Keyboard Events**:
   - `keydown`, `keyup`, and `keypress`.
   - Example: Logs key presses in real-time.

4. **Form Events**:
   - `focus`, `blur`, `change`, and `submit`.
   - Example: Alerts the user on form submission or input changes.

### Steps to Use:
1. Open the respective HTML files for each event type.
2. Interact with the page to see the events in action.
